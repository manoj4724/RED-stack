This is a sensitive experiment to handle, which uses thin polymer memberane in between the stack. I can produce Max of 1.5V - 2V of max voltage and 0.2A of max current for a series of 10 cell/ membrane stacked together.

RED ( Reverse ElectroDialysis ) uses the fact that salts are made up of ions: positively and negatively charged particles. In seawater these are mainly Na+ (the sodium ion) and Cl- (the chloride ion). And when a salt is dissolved in water, these ions appear as loose particles in the water. Two types of membranes are now used at RED: membranes that only allow positive ions to pass through (CEM, Cation Exchange Membranes) and membranes that only allow negative ions to pass through (AEM, Anion Exchange Membranes).

When salt water flows between two such membranes (with fresh water on the other side of the membranes), the ions from the salt water will want to migrate to the fresh water. However, due to the membranes used, a CEM on one side and an AEM on the other side, both types of ions will migrate in opposite directions. This creates a transport of positively charged parts in one direction and negatively charged parts in the other direction. This creates a + and a â€“ side, a kind of battery, an electrochemical cell.The amount of electrical energy available is determined by the difference in salinity between the two types of water and the temperature of the water. The actual power generated depends on a number of technical matters such as the selectivity of the membranes used and the resistance of the electrochemical cell. Selectivity is the extent to which a membrane is able to allow only one ion species to pass through. And the resistance describes the hindrance that the ions encounter on the way from the salt water to the fresh water.
